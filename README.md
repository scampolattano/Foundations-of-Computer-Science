# *Foundations of Computer Science - 2025 Project*

This repository contains the project work for the "Foundations of Computer Science" course as part of the Data Science Master's Degree program of University of Milano-Bicocca.

## Project Description
The primary goal of this project is to apply foundational computer science principles to extract insights and process data.
The tasks involve working with a dataset containing trip information, and the project focuses on various extraction and cleaning techniques.

## Examples of Key Tasks include:
- Extract trips with a trip_distance greater than 50
- Identify and extract all records where the trip distance exceeds 50 units.
- Handle missing payment_type values
- Extract all records where the payment_type field is missing and explore potential methods to handle these missing values.
